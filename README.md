# School_District_Analaysis

### Mission
Help school district to make informed decision by analysing the school expenditure data. 


### Problem:
School district has found the discrepencies with the marks in one of the school. School district administration have decided to take away score for the Thomas High School and they want to know if it has any impact on the overall population. They have also requested some of the key stats like top schools with highest pass rate based on the budget, size and type. 


### Execution
As suggested Mathmatics score for all the 461 students of the Thomas High Schools were taken. They were replaced with the NaN. After replacing the value with Nan(equivalent to the 0) following were the effect:
  - overall passing percentage dropped to 65%
  - overall passing percentage in the district dropped to 64.9%


#### Top and Least Performer Schools:

  - Most successful shool are Charter type whereas District types are least performing
  - Student sizes are compartively smaller in the top perfomer school. 
  - Interestingly budget per student in most least performing school is usually greater. It may have to do with how effectively budget is being used in educational purposes

#### Math vs Reading Score by school and grades

#### Effect of Budget

  - Results are quite different than what i had expected. Analysis clearly shows that schools with higher budget per student are least performing. In my opinion it is also the matter about how budget is being allocated within the school. 

 #### Effect of School Size

  - Schools with smaller class size are performing well. 

  ### Effect by School Type

    - Without the doubt Charter school are performing quite well than the district schools.
      

  ### Summary : 
  It is quite hard to identify the extent of the discrepencies made to cover up. However the data shows there is quite difference in the student passing rate based on the student size, budget and type of the school.
